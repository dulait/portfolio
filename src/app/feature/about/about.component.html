      About Me
    </h2>

    <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-300 text-lg">
      <p>
        I'm a passionate software engineer with 5+ years of experience building
        web applications that scale. I specialize in React, TypeScript, and Node.js,
        with a strong focus on creating intuitive user interfaces and robust backend systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        My journey in software development began with a curiosity about how things work
        under the hood. Today, I leverage that curiosity to solve complex problems and
        build products that make a difference. I believe in writing clean, maintainable
        code and following best practices.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you'll find me contributing to open-source projects,
        reading tech blogs, or exploring new technologies. I'm always eager to learn
        and grow as a developer.
